Hello, I'm so proud that you are here.

I'm Taha,

I'm full stack developer working on front-end, back-end and improve my skills in DevOps. I'm using React Js/Native, Node Js, kubernetes, docker and some tools etc...\
Also, I'm very interested ðŸ‘€ in Web3 and distributed system.

You can find almost my project on [my github](https://github.com/TahaGitHub?tab=repositories). Some of projects did when I was student at university, and some of projects I developed for learning and for improve my skills. And of course during my work experiences at companies.
